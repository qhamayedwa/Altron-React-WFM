Prompt: Apply Altron CI 2024 Gradient Backgrounds to the Website

Rebrand this website using Altron Corporate Identity (CI) 2024 gradient rules.
Focus specifically on implementing gradient backgrounds according to the official approved combinations.

1. Use Only Approved Gradient Colour Combinations

Based on the Altron CI gradient rules, apply gradients only using the approved pairs below:

Approved Altron gradient pairs:

#54B8DF → #28468D

#54DADF → #EBF982

#EF865B → #EBF982

#C0F2D7 → #EBF982

#54DADF → #FFFFFF

#EBF982 → #FFFFFF

#EF865B → #FFFFFF

#C0F2D7 → #FFFFFF

#54B8DF → #FFFFFF

#28468D → #1F4650

Use clean linear gradients, e.g.:

background: linear-gradient(135deg, #54B8DF, #28468D);

2. Brand Behaviour for Gradients

Follow the brand rules:

Keep gradients subtle, modern, and not overpowering.

Use gradients sparingly—not as full-page fills unless appropriate.

Combine gradients with ample whitespace to maintain the Altron look.

Gradients must not clash with text; apply WCAG AA contrast rules.

Do not mix colours in ways not approved in the CI.

3. Where to Apply Gradients

Apply gradients to:

Hero / masthead backgrounds

Section dividers or highlight sections

Button backgrounds (only if aligned to CI contrast rules)

Viewfinder device backgrounds (solid or gradient allowed per CI)

Do NOT apply gradients to:

Body backgrounds

Large text backgrounds

Logos

Icons

4. Implementation Requirements

Replace all existing background colours with brand-compliant gradients where appropriate.

Create reusable CSS variables for all approved gradient combinations. Example:

:root {
  --grad-blue-navy: linear-gradient(135deg, #54B8DF, #28468D);
  --grad-teal-yellow: linear-gradient(135deg, #54DADF, #EBF982);
}


Ensure gradients work responsively and look clean on high-resolution screens.

Maintain Altron’s clean, optimistic, modern aesthetic.

5. Output Expectations

Update all CSS/HTML files accordingly.

Ensure all gradient usage matches the official brand CI from the uploaded guide.
